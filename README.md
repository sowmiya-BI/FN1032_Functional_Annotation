# FN1032 Functional Annotation

## Objective
To perform functional annotation of the hypothetical protein FN1032 from
Fusobacterium nucleatum using Biopython and BLAST.

## Input Data
- Protein sequence in FASTA format

## Methodology
1. Read protein sequence using Biopython
2. Perform BLASTp analysis against NCBI nr database
3. Analyze homologous sequences
4. Assign function based on sequence similarity

## Results
BLAST analysis revealed strong similarity to CvpA family proteins from
Fusobacterium species with very low E-values.

## Conclusion
Based on homology, FN1032 is predicted to be a CvpA family protein.
Experimental validation is required to confirm its biological role.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Biopython
- NCBI BLAST
